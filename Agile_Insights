Make tradeoffs consciously instead of accidentally.

"Not being able to manage Work in Progress is a symptom of not knowing what is most important". (Al Shalloway)

"There is more value created with overall alignment than with local excellence". (Don Reinertsen)

Continuous improvement is better than deferred perfection (Der Bienen Hirte)

Ego plays a bit role - it's not about the individual - it's all about the team. (Der Bienen Hirte)

There is no stability cause the environment changes constantly - you need try to improve continuously, otherwise it will get worse. (Der Bienen Hirte)

The more your ego is in the way, the lower is the likelihood that you change and the higher the chance that the world reveloves without you. (Der Bienen Hirte)
