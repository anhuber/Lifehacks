Make tradeoffs consciously instead of accidentally.

"Not being able to manage Work in Progress is a symptom of not knowing what is most important". (Al Shalloway)

"There is more value created with overall alignment than with local excellence". (Don Reinertsen) 

Continuous improvement is better than deferred perfection (Der Bienen Hirte)

Fail = First Attempt In Learning
